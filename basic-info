What is devops? => DevOps is a software development approach emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery to provide high-quality products to customers quickly and efficiently.

Cycle of devops. => DevOps Lifecycle is the set of phases that includes DevOps for taking part in Development and Operation group duties for quicker software program delivery. DevOps follows positive 
techniques that consist of code, building, testing, releasing, deploying, operating, displaying, and planning. DevOps lifecycle follows a range of phases such as non-stop development, non-stop integration, 
non-stop testing, non-stop monitoring, and non-stop feedback.

What is service? => In DevOps, "service" typically refers to a component or application that provides specific functionality within a software system. These services are often designed to be modular, loosely coupled,
and independently deployable. Each service performs a specific task or set of tasks and communicates with other services through well-defined interfaces, such as APIs.
Services are often organized according to the microservices architectural pattern, where large applications are broken down into smaller, manageable services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. 
This approach allows teams to focus on specific features or functionalities, enabling faster development cycles, easier maintenance, and improved scalability.

What is microservice? => Microservice is a small, loosely coupled distributed service. Each microservice is designed to perform a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. 
It allows you to take a large application and decompose or break it into easily manageable small components with narrowly defined responsibilities. It is considered the building block of modern applications. 
Microservices can be written in a variety of programming languages, and frameworks, and each service acts as a mini-application on its own.

What is monolithic and microlithic architecture? =>Monolithic Architecture:

In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. All components of the application, including the user interface, business logic, and data access layers,
are tightly integrated and deployed as a single executable or a single codebase. Monolithic applications typically run on a single server or a small cluster of servers.

Advantages of Monolithic Architecture:

Simplicity: Easier to develop, test, and deploy due to its single-unit nature.
Performance: Lower overhead as components communicate directly with each other.
Traditional: Many legacy systems are built with monolithic architecture.

Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture:

Scalability: Scaling the application can be challenging because the entire application needs to be replicated.
Maintenance: Changes to one part of the application may require rebuilding and redeploying the entire application.
Technology Diversity: Limited flexibility in using different technologies for different components.
Microlithic Architecture:

Microlithic architecture is a hybrid approach that combines the simplicity of monolithic architecture with the modularity and scalability of microservices architecture. In a microlithic architecture, 
the application is divided into smaller, independently deployable units called "microliths." Each microlith encapsulates a specific business domain or functionality, and it can be developed, deployed, and 
scaled independently.

Advantages of Microlithic Architecture:

Modularity: Easier to understand, develop, and maintain than a monolith, but still simpler than full microservices.
Scalability: More scalable than a monolith because individual microliths can be scaled independently.
Flexibility: Allows for using different technologies for different microliths, providing more flexibility than a monolithic architecture.

Disadvantages of Microlithic Architecture:

Complexity: Although less complex than microservices, microlithic architectures still introduce some additional complexity compared to monoliths.
Integration: Requires careful consideration of how microliths interact with each other to avoid creating tightly coupled components.
